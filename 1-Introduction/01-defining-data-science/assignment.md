# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | How can we use data to improve educational outcomes for children in schools? | Test scores, outcomes after graduating high school, styles of teaching | Database | Most effective ways of teaching that lead to better performance and outcomes |
| Nonprofit | How can we ensure nonprofits are working honestly and efficiently | Funds raised, expenses, similar expenses at other nonprofits | Database or spreadsheets | Ensure that funds raised by nonprofits are used well and not wasted, and help bring them closer to their stated goals |
| Productivity | How can I make sure I'm using my time well and being productive at work? | Time spent on each project, time spent doing non-work-related activities, work output | Spreadsheets | See where time is being wasted or things aren't being done efficiently, and make changes to improve work output |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
